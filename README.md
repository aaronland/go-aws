# go-aws

Opinionated package of wrapper, helper and utility functions for working with the Go AWS SDK.

## Documentation

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/aaronland/go-aws.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aaronland/go-aws/v3)

Documentation remains incomplete and many tests are lacking despite this being a "v3" release.

## Motivation

There are many wrapper libraries for working with the Go AWS SDK. This one is mine. It is NOT comprehensive and instead reflects those services which occupy my time or have done so in the past.

It is the merging of a number of other `aaronland/go-aws-SERVICE` packages. The `v3` versioning is simply a reflection of version "3" being greater than the most recent `aaronland/go-aws-SERVICE` package.
